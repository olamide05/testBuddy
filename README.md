TestBuddy IE — Reduce Driving Test Waits, Increase Pass Rates

Tagline: Find an earlier test, practise smarter, swap slots safely — and unlock insurance savings when you pass.

TestBuddy IE is a React web app that helps Irish learner drivers (and their families) cut through 6-month wait times, prepare effectively, and book earlier — ethically and transparently. It combines a smart slot watcher, a guided swap marketplace, a centre intelligence map, and an AI practice coach. A future Insurers page lets users enter their reg to see quotes and potential discounts based on readiness/pass outcomes.
